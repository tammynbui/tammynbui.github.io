    <p class="who">I am a free and intimate soul looking to incorporate art making and creative expression with business on an international scale. My practice and the way I put myself out to the world is rather intimate. My way of art making depicts memories, nostalgia, and a free soul. My work is like a map of my very soul as I am rather in tune with my emotions and tend to get very close with the content. It is a very intimate process in producing my work given the immense amount of time I put into the details, no matter how subtle. Some of my influences are bullet journaling, music, college, and friends.</p>
    <p class="who">I am in school for a degree in International Business. I also have a visual arts minor. I naturally gravitate towards art and would like to challenge myself with creative thinking in regards to the field of business, hence my interest in marketing. Marketing challenges one to bring in new and fresh ideas. This is where I can incorporate my artistic side into my field. I can be the person to bring in the new and fresh ideas. Meanwhile, the international part of my major is reflective of how I am a free soul. I like to explore and put myself out there. I feel open to possibilities.</p>
    <p class="who">I am very close to my work and commit a lot of time into it. Art to me is really personal. I would like to incorporate art to business, making it an outlet for my creativity. I have a growth mindset and like to push my limits!</p>
