    <h2 class="text-center who-title">who?</h2>
    <p class="who">I am in school for a degree in International Business. The international part of my major is reflective of how I am a free soul. I like to explore & put myself out there. I feel open to possibilities. I have particular interests in project/event planning and marketing. I completely invest myself in the event planning process with a strong desire of executing the best events possible. I also have a visual arts minor. I have always naturally gravitated towards art & have a lot of fun creating, demonstrated through my works.</p>
    <p class="who">I am a free & intimate soul who enjoys art marking. Art to me is really personal. My practice & the way I put myself out to the world is rather intimate. My way of art making depicts memories, nostalgia, & a free soul. My work is like a map of my very soul as I am rather in tune with my emotions & tend to get very close with the content. It is a very intimate process in producing my work given the immense amount of time I put into the details, no matter how subtle. Some of my influences are bullet journaling, music, board games, college, & friends.</p>
    <p class="who">I am very close to my work & commit a lot of time & detail into it, whether it be in art, school, or event planning. I always want to produce the best results no matter the task. I have a growth mindset & continually want to push my limits!</p>
