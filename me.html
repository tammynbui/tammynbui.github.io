    <p class="who">I am a free and intimate soul looking to incorporate art making and creative expression with business on an international scale. My practice and the way I put myself out to the world is rather intimate. My way of art making depicts memories, nostalgia, and a free soul. My work is like a map of my very soul as I am rather in tune with my emotions and tend to get very close with the content. It is a very intimate process in producing my work given the immense amount of time I put into the details, no matter how subtle. Some of my biggest influences are bullet journaling, music, college, and friends, as seen with my works.</p>
    <p class="who">I am in school for a degree in International Business. I also have a visual arts minor. I naturally gravitate towards art and would like to challenge myself with creative thinking in regards to the field of business, hence my interest in marketing. Marketing is nonrestrictive and has many possibilities. It challenges one to bring in new and fresh ideas. This is where I can incorporate my artistic side into my field. I can be the person to bring in the new and fresh ideas. Meanwhile, the international part of my major is reflective of how I am a free soul that cannot be contained and stuck in one spot. I like to explore and put myself out there. I feel open to possibilities.</p>
    <p class="who">I am very close to my work and commit a lot of time into it. Art to me is really personal. I would like to incorporate art to business and treat business the same. I want to pursue marketing and make it another outlet for my creativity.</p>
